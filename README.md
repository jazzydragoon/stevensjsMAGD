This is my GitHub repository for the MAGD 150 GitHub assignment.

I've created this branch to add my lab 2, lab 4, and lab 7 assignments.

Lab 2 consisted of multiple colors and shapes with transparencies, as well as using art skills like balance and symmetry to make it look nice.

Lab 4 was made of shapes that could have movement when clicking specific parts of the piece, and crafting motion,

Lab 7 consisted of retro-themed hearts that were made of a pattern, with loop, push and pop elements incorporated.
